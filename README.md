c. Country Wise Distribution (Countries with least suicide cases)
d. Year wise least suicide cases.

l. Calculating the each country-wise percentage towards overall suicide cases data. Instead of this another feature illustrate the suicide cases percentage of each country column with their population.
m. Top Ten countries table and plot after calculating the "each country-wise percentage towards overall suicide cases data".
n. Data distribution of top ten countries (Table + plot) having most suicide cases with respect to their population.
o. Data distribution of ten countries (Table + plot) having least suicide cases with respect to their population.
p. Measure the difference of each year regarding their previous year. Also figured out the weightage of data in a specific year w.r.t overall year data. Finally, generated a trend line plot.
